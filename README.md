The second project of The Odin Project - Foundations Course

It's the first serious project that I'm going to build. Recipes was so linear, it was a challenge to do things without order.

I think I'have a chaotic way to work, so the first and important challenge for this project is to have a good work-flow with a basic scheme to follow.

It's easy to find in the design four block, so working on one of them per time, after defining them in html, seems a good way.

--End of the project--

The project is done, I struggled a lot, more than I thought. The main problem was to not keep in mind the rule of the main box and how that influence the child-box. I forgot about the use of stretch option so I had problem with the occupation of the space by the child-box. There are some errors, or better to say, there is a lot of useless and low-efficient code.
I will correct it in future.
